PNP's Not Pong README

I.  Installation

	To install PNPs Not Pong on Windows, simply extract Setup.exe from
	the archive you downloaded and run it.

II.  Video Setup

	Currently, PNP's Not Pong only runs in windowed mode at 800x600 resolution.

III.  Playing PNP's Not Pong

	When you first start PNP's Not Pong, it is by default on the Easy
	difficulty setting and the screen is frozen.  To start the game,
	press the SPACE BAR.  At any point during the game, pressing the
	SPACE BAR will pause/unpause the game.  After a player scores, a new
	round begins, and the screen is frozen again.  Pressing SPACE BAR
	starts the round.

	The longer the ball is in play, the faster it goes.  The ball's speed
	is reset at the start of each new round.

	The difficulty level may be changed at any point during play by
	pressing the "d" key.  Note that there is no indicator telling which
	difficulty level the game is currently in, but it should be easy to
	tell by pressing "d" to switch back and forth between Easy and Hard.

	A game is won by a player reaching 5 points.  When a game is won, the
	scores are reset and a new game begins.

	Press ESCAPE at any time to quit the game.
